Hi everyone, it's me, Mert Sarac.

I've been working as a Software and Project Development Specialist since July 2018 at [Süvari](https://www.suvari.com.tr/). I live in Istanbul. I have so much experiments about Cloud data processes, machine learning and big data analysis. I'd exercised my information about them while developing cloud neuromarketing platform at [Neurolize](https://www.neurolize.com/) for 3 years. I've been mostly designing the projects of workflow applications, business APIs, WPF/Xamarin applications and work portals' architecture and also developing them on .NET platform. I'd like to prefer using technologies just like MongoDB, ReactJS, AngularJS, Node.js, Typescript at these projects.

I've also been developing IoT projects and being interested in electronics as a hobbyist.
